hi, i'm [Samet Samyeli](https://linkedin.com/in/sametsamyeli), self-taught fullstack developer & tech. founder of gazla.co building türkiye's most ambitious startup platform connecting founders with global investors. launched with a single tweet: 150k impressions, 3,500 visitors, zero funding, zero external support.

by day, i'm a medical imaging software engineer working remotely with usa-based healthcare teams from türkiye. hipaa certified. i build clinical tools on dicom, cornerstone, and ohif where patient data security isn't optional and mistakes aren't allowed.

i've shipped projects for vakko, lc waikiki, koton, and samsung turkey. high-stakes clients, tight deadlines, zero complaints.

when the devastating earthquake hit turkey in february 2023, i helped establish the open software network (aya) within just three days and served as a product management lead, coordinating and directing work across more than 20,000 volunteer developers. i also contributed hands-on to critical emergency platforms such as afetharita and deprem.io — volunteer-built tools that made a real, on-the-ground impact during rescue and coordination efforts. the movement was covered by international outlets including [time news](https://time.com/6254500/turkey-earthquake-twitter-musk-rescue/) [yahoo news](https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_b5309b8f-e5aa-4e46-97bc-3d9b1aebe95a) and [cnn](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/video/news/local/rancho-penasquitos-man-working-with-thousands-online-to-help-turkey-earthquake-victims/3170373/)

outside of code: 13 medals, 2 cups, mediterranean sailing champion in ilca class. sailing taught me how to make fast decisions in changing conditions — a skill that transfers directly to building products.

i build things. i ship things. i solve hard problems.

open to new projects and collaborations.
